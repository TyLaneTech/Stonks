While researching a company I was looking to invest in, I noticed it was difficult to find all the financial figures I was searching for in one simple consolidated location. Also, many stock market financial indicators aren't very telling on their own, but exist commonly serve as variables in more powerful equations. Given this, I decided to consolidate the data I find valuable, as well as calculate figures derived from formulas commonly used in the stock market.  This repository contains the code that retrieves, parses, and formats data from the market. The full project is live here: www.TyLane.tech/stonks
